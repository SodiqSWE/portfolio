        Hi, I'm Sodiq! A software developer with 2+ years of experience creating scalable solutions, 
        from building APIs and ETL tools to designing frontends with Vue.js and React. 
        I enjoy collaborating remotely and exploring new tech like TypeScript in my personal projects. 
        Outside of work, I’m into gaming, cars, and PC building, which keeps my creativity and problem-solving skills sharp.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new tech trends, playing games,
        or enjoying a good anime series.
